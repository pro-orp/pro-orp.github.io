I'm a PhD student in Software Engineering from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/). My main research interests lie in graph neural networks, adaptive sampling, and graph foundation models, with a particular focus on spatio-temporal prediction and the application of graph learning in physics simulation.
